OPAT - Once Upon A Time
    Goal: Create a websocket/based javascript game.
                        
        Goal 1
            Players have 3 types of cards with phrases.  These cards can fit
            together to make a sentence.
            
            Players can play one of each type of card per turn.  One player must abstain.
            Card czar votes on winning cards one 'set' at a time without seeing the others.
            
            No clue when the game is over.

            Actions:
                Server provides cards for playing.
                User plays card.
                Server provides played cards to czar for picking.
                
                Player times out
                Czar times out
                
            Events (server side)
                Player connects.
                Game starts.
                Player disconnects
                
            Events (client side)
                
            
            
            Notes:
                Obviously, there would be no attempt at a story, so don't try.
                Maybe theme the "story" around a certain player?
        Goal 2
        
            Players can vote to overrule the czar?
        
            Winning players can submit cards.
            Older, non-default cards must retired.
